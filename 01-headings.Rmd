# Numbered headings level one

## Numbered headings level two

Numbering can be turned off using numbered_sections: false in the index.Rmd YAML.

Headings can be unnumbered by adding the attribute - or .unnumbered to them.
E.g. 
# heading {-}

This makes use of pandoc markdow header attributes extension.

## Headings in table of contents

Unnumbered headings will still appear in the table of contents.
