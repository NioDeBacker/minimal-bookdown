# Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key.
In the index.Rmd file, in the YAML pass the .bib files to the bibliography key.
In this YAML there are a few options to style your citations.
For example when we write 
```md
R Markdown [@xie2015]
````
We get: R Markdown [@xie2015]
